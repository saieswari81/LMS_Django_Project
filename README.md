Updated: 09/29/2022
I have uploaded three new files.
1. docker-compose_postgresql.yaml. Running this docker-compose will
raise the postgresql container.

2. loan_rules.csv (this file is given to us by 
our trainer Mr. Venkat in one of our sessions. This is not the
file from our s3 bucket)

3. python_db_postgresql.py - To insert loan_rules.csv values in to the loan_rules table 
inside the postgresql database please use the 
"python_db_postgresql.py" script (run this only once to
avoid multiple insertions of the same data.)
